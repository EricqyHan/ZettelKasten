Listen to LEON TONIGHT!!!!

## This is harder than OOP and JS but it is about getting a job.

Get to the NERDS!

## Behavior Questions

CAR - Cause Action Result
CAR > STAR

Active Recall and Spaced Repetition are your friends

ANKI is very important - THE BANK will need it
We know the science behind Repeated Spaced Repetition

Bring Anki back into the game

Wake up and make the decision to get a job as a Software Engineer

- Problem is people say they want it but they kind of want it

Go throught the Trough of Sorrow and embrace the suck

- DO YOU WANT IT?

USA Prespective on getting a job

How to play the game?
Up to you if you want to play...

These are moral decisions
Leon is a by any means necessary to get the job

This is a hard process so one day you can wake up to a better job and a happier career

Six main pieces
1 - Crafting your story
2 - Online presence
3 - Hitlist
4 - Inreview Process
5 - CAR/PREP
6 - Interviewing

## 1 - Crafting Your Story

Why are you here? - Why are you the best person for this job. Thinking of all of your highlights. Pick the best things from those experiences.
We need to get past the bootcamp smell. Get rid of that bootcamp smell. This is where journey ends for a lot of people since we can't get rid of that sniff test. Leave junior or aspiring engineer out of your portfolio. NO ONE WANTS TO HIRE A ASPIRING OR JUNIOR ENGINEER. Once we get past the sniff, we can make it to the nerds.

- Then it comes down to CAN YOU CODE? and DO I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS?
- We can do a lot of stuff that tips it in our favor.
- Look at my 100 hours project
- 100 devs team projects
- green squares on github
- When you are interviewing, see what they are like on Twitter
  - Oops, I didn't mean to drop my Magic the Gathering cards ... wink wink
  - Prove to them they want to work with them
  - Play the games
- Get past the bootcamp smell and don't mention the bootcamp. Self taught coder.
- Don't utter the word Bootcamp - Our story is more than a bootcamp
- Bootcamp or self-taught engineers is something you don't bring up because of gatekeepers
- Present a good story

- Present the truth in the best possible light
- Don't snitch on yourself. Let then dig.
- Nobody cares about your projects
- Don't let them know you just started.
- Highlight your experiences and talk abuout how they lead to where you are

Talk about your wins
A server at a restaurabt. Working with a wide range or tools and tech. POS system sucked. Realized I can probably write better software.
Pandemic hit. Hard. ROots as software. Excited to be interviewing with your company today.

My Story.
at 00:58
After I graduated College I got a job as an HVAC engineer working with HVAC systems all over New Jersey. Realized the office was very disorganized and I could create an application to help imporove organization. I created an application where we can store information for all of our clients and all the equipment they had at thier sites. This way our techs could update equipment information at the site or check what they needed before they went. Been working with a few different companies and want to return to my roots as a software engineer. Excited to be interviewing your company today.

## 2 - Online Persona

Portfolio, Twitter, Linkedin - Let the Powers combine
Twitter is an amazing resource - one of best resource to help you get a job
When you are trying to get a job, we don't apply. We network our way in.

- Don't click apply. WE get referred into these jobs.
- Most tech companies, engineers get referral bonuses.
- These referral can go from $2,000 to $30,000. This is why we network our way in.
- It is something that immediately helps you get past the sniff test - someone has already vouched for you. Carries more weight than github and coding ability.
- Twitter cheat code - We need to turn them from an acquaintance to a friend

Follow 50 Engineers where you will be applying

- It might take you a bit to find them, look for #remotedeveloper and put themn in a twitter list. Interact with their content.
- Add them to a private list and SEMESTER FREIND THEM
- I love following you on Twitter can we get a coffee chat.
- Share content that makes you look like an engineer. Read hacker news and tweet about it.
- Build relationships.

Get Linkedin and Angelist setup
Join 100devs linkedin group
js, node, react - get endorsed these skills

Use Leon's template gets past the sniff test better
Class 25 if you need to review

The hit list - we will need a lot of customization to our resuems

- We might get around 30 versions.

## 3 - The HIT LIST

Get a referral to get a job in tech.
What is a hitlist

- Take individuals you want to interact with a job and reach out to them.
- Network my way into 60 applications.
